#Form Processing with Checkboxes
This seminar session is about how to process checkboxes in an HTML form. 
* Put *chk_form.php* and *winners.php* on a web server. Check you can view the form.
* In *winners.php* add some code to display the options the user has chosen. The user's choices should be accessible as a PHP array (have a good look at the names of the checkboxes in *chk_form.php*). Try using a *print_r()* to display what the user has chosen.
* If you can get this to work, output the selected countries using a foreach loop.
* Finally, can you check if the user has answered correctly. This is probably a bit trickier than it first appears. There are a number of ways to do it e.g. sorting and then comparing the arrays using an if statement. 
* Can you add suitable validation e.g. If the user doesn't choose any teams.
